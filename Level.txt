This document defines the structure of a level file.  Each file can be thought of as a series of commands
sent to a state machine (similar to gcode).  Thus, the command "COLOR,MIRROR,255,255,255" would set the color
of all subsequent mirrors to pure white.  All level files should start with a SIZE field.  All sizes/positions
are integer arguments.  Rotations may be represented as floating point and are measure in degrees. 
Elements may not be placed outside of the board.

Available commands
SIZE,<width>,<height>
COLOR,<component>,<red>,<green>,<blue>
MIRROR,<x>,<y>,<rotation>,<width>,<height>
BLOCKER,<x>,<y>,<rotation>,<width>,<height>
TARGET,<x>,<y>,<needed>
LASER,<x>,<y>,<rotation>

The COLOR command is special as it can set several values based on <component>.  This field can be set to any of the main
components on the board (MIRROR,BLOCKER,LASER,TARGET) but it can also be set to BEAM, WALL, or BACKGROUND. BEAM sets the
color of both laser beams and target recievers. Except BEAM, colors should only be set once.
