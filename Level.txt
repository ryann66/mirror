This document defines the structure of a level file.  Each file can be thought of as a series of commands
sent to a state machine (similar to gcode).  Thus, the command "COLOR,MIRROR,255,255,255" would set the color
of all subsequent mirrors to pure white.  All level files should start with a SIZE field.  All sizes/positions
are integer arguments.  Rotations may be represented as floating point and are measure in degrees. 
Elements may not be placed outside of the board.  Movement enabled should be an integer, where anything
but 0 is interpreted as true (movement enabled)

Available commands
SIZE,<width>,<height>
COLOR,<component>,<red>,<green>,<blue>
MIRROR,<x>,<y>,<rotation>,<width>,<height>,<movement_enabled>
BLOCKER,<x>,<y>,<rotation>,<width>,<height>,<movement_enabled>
TARGET,<x>,<y>,<rotation>,<needed>,<movement_enabled>
LASER,<x>,<y>,<rotation>,<movement_enabled>

The COLOR command is special as it can set several values based on <component>.  This field can be set to any of the main
components on the board (MIRROR,BLOCKER,LASER,TARGET) but it can also be set to BEAM or BACKGROUND. BEAM sets the
color of both laser beams and target recievers.
